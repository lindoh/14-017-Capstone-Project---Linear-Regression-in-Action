## Introduction
This is a Data Science Bootcamp project focused on Linear Regression.

## Dataset Attributes
The dataset contains information about houses in Ames, Iowa. It contains 2930 property sales data for the period between 2006 and 2010, and 81 variables. 
However, some of the variables have been removed for the benefit of this exercise. The provided dataset contains:
* **Year_Built:** 
* **Year_Remod_Add:** 
* **Total_Bsmt_SF:** 
* **First_Flr_SF:** 
* **Second_Flr_SF:** 
* **Gr_Liv_Area:** size of above grade, ground living area in square feet
* **Full_Bath:** 
* **Half_Bath:** 
* **Bedroom_AbvGr:** 
* **Kitchen_AbvGr:** 
* **TotRms_AbvGrd:** 
* **Fireplaces:** 
* **Garage_Area:** size of garage in square feet
* **Sale_Price:** sale price of the house in dollars

## Objective
The goal of this task is to analyse the relationship between these variables and build a multiple linear regression model to predict the sales prices based on the 'Gr_Liv_Area' and 'Garage_Area` variables.
